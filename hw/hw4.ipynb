    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will gain practice performing exploratory data analysis of a new data set using SQL. The homework is similar to homework two -- only this time you will again pick the dataset, the question, and your plan for analysis. There is also a question on hypothesis testing and quantitative reasoning. SQL is a very, very common data science tool and it makes sense to spend time practicing SQL to solidify and reinforce your understanding of databases. This homework is intended to give you this opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, doing data analysis is not a matter of completing steps assigned to you by an instructor. So in this HW, like in HW3, you will get the chance to investigate your own question. You are highly encouraged to challenge yourself and really investigate something that is interesting to you while doing this assignment."

For instance, when we investigated the baseball database we found that certain players had played in dozens of all star games. We could validate that data by checking Wikipedia (another source) to see if the data seemed to accurately represent baseball history. You are highly encouraged to be creative in doing validation. For instance, if you are looking at data about high school graduation rates you might need to compute the mean graduation rate from your dataset and compare it to official graduation statistics provided by school district leaders in news articles. Do the statistics match? Are they close? What might account for discrepancies? To answer this question, you should write code and describe your research, linking to sources where appropriate."
