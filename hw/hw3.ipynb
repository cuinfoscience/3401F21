This notebook is designed to help you practice that process! You are highly encouraged to challenge yourself and really investigate something that is interesting to you while doing this assignment."

    "\n",
    "Data does not emerge from nowhere. It is deliberately collected and stored as part of social processes. Find some aspect of your data and validate it against another source. You will need to write some code and do some research for this. For instance, when we investigated the baseball database we found that certain players had played in dozens of all star games. We could validate that data by checking Wikipedia (another source) to see if the data seemed to accurately represent baseball history. You are highly encouraged to be creative in doing validation. For instance, if you are looking at data about high school graduation rates you might need to compute the mean graduation rate from your dataset and compare it to official graduation statistics provided by school district leaders news articles. Do the statistics match? Are they close? What might account for discrepancies? To answer this question, you should write code and describe your research, linking to sources where appropriate."
