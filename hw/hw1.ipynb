    "Representatives elected to the U.S. House are given budgets to hire staff and to run their offices in Washington, D.C. as well as in their home district. Senior leadership offices and committees also receive budgets to hire their own staff and conduct their business. These funds cannot be used for personal or campaign expenses and there is no reserve fund if members run over budget. These budgets vary across members and committees  and depend on a variety of factors. Detailed records of these disbursements are [published quarterly as CSV files](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements/archive) going back to 2010.\n",
