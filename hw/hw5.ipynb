For instance, you could group by team and aggregate by taking the max (instead of the average)."

    "\n",
    "You have probably heard that [correlation does not imply causation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). If your two variables are (even somewhat) correlated or anticorrelated, can you provide an explanation for what might cause the correlation between A and B? For instance, in men, arthritis and baldness are correlated. Men who have arthritis are also often bald. But that does not mean that arthritis _causes_ baldness. There is an underlying variable (age) that actually causes these correlated observations. Can you think of a similar explanation for your data? If your variables are totally uncorrelated, then you should answer this question by discussing a third variable that is likely correlated with one of your two variables, and then explaining how correlation with this third variable may not imply causation."
